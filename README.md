## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (font-face, variables, utility classes)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (media querry)

### What I learned

I've learned the use of font-display: swap and personalised markers

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/outfit/Outfit-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400 600;
  font-display: swap;
}

@font-face {
  font-family: "Young Serif";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/young-serif/YoungSerif-Regular.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 400 600;
  font-display: swap;
}

ul {
  padding-bottom: 25px;
  list-style-type: none;
}

ul li::before {
  content: ". ";
  color: var(--rose-800);
  margin-right: 20px;
  font-weight: 600;
}
```
